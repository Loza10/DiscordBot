# DiscordBot
Discord bot to keep track of user game data. Uses regression to predict placements in the game. Also keeps track of rankings and information regarding specific 'seasons' of the game. Can't include the token for obvious reasons. Reading the csv files in is a bit messy and can be improved but it works.
